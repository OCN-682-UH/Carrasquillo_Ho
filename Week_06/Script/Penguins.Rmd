# This is my intro to Penguins
Today we are going to work with penguin data to learn *RMarkdown*  

# Load libraries
```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

# Inspect the data
```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

# Make a plot
```{r}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(penguins, mapping = aes(x= species, y = body_mass_g, color = island)) + 
  geom_violin() +
  labs(x = "Species", 
       y = "Body Mass (g)") 
```
```{r}
